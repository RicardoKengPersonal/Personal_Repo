# Use Case Diagram (UCD)

*In the scope of this project, there is a direct relationship of 1 to 1 between Use Cases (UC) and User Stories (US).*

This will be the only document that uses "US/UC"; the rest will be prefixed with "US".

This is the global Use Case Diagram, and it displays the main functions of the main roles in the application:

*For each Use Case/User Story (UC/US), evidence is provided below of the application of the main activities of the software development process (requirements, analysis, design, testing and code).*
