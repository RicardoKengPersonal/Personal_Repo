### 1.4. Found out Dependencies 

* Before effectively and systematically registering employees, as described in this user story (US03), it is necessary
to first create and register jobs, as specified in "US02 - As an HRM, I want to register a job."
The presence of documented job positions is essential for subsequently linking them with collaborators during the 
registration procedure. Therefore, guaranteeing the presence of documented job roles is crucial for streamlining the 
process of employee registration in an organized fashion.
* Also, before registering employees, as described in this user story (US03), it is possible to have registered skills to
a future collaborator, as specified in "US01 - Registers skills that may be appointed to a collaborator."
