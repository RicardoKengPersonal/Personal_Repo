# Supplementary Specification (FURPS+)

## Functionality

_Specifies functionalities that:  
&nbsp; &nbsp; (i) are common across several US/UC;  
&nbsp; &nbsp; (ii) are not related to US/UC, namely: Audit, Reporting and Security._


> >- All images should be in svg format.
> >- The application must support the english language.
> >- The user must be registered in the portal in order to be able to use it to post comments, and report faults and malfunctions of equipment.
     

## Usability

_Evaluates the user interface. It has several subcategories,
among them: error prevention; interface aesthetics and design; help and
documentation; consistency and standards._


> >- The application must have a user-friendly environment.
> >- Let users post comments, and report faults and malfunctions of equipment.
     

## Reliability

Refers to the integrity, compliance and interoperability of the software. The requirements to be considered are: frequency and severity of failure, possibility of recovery, possibility of prediction, accuracy, average time between failures.


> >- The application needs to be secure and protected against attacks.
> >- The application must be able to recover from failures.
> >- The application should not crash.
> >- The application must support the English language.
     

## Performance

Evaluates the performance requirements of the software, namely: response time, start-up time, recovery time, memory consumption, CPU usage, load capacity and application availability.


> >- The application shouldn't have any delays when operating.
     

## Supportability

_The supportability requirements gathers several characteristics, such as:
testability, adaptability, maintainability, compatibility,
configurability, installability, scalability and more._


> >- The application must be able to support many users at a time.
> >- The application must be able to support various types of devices.
> >- The application must be easy to maintain and to correct bugs and glitches.
