## System Overview
The GreenSpace Management System (GSMS) is a comprehensive software solution for managing urban green spaces like parks, gardens, and public areas. At its core, GSMS seeks to simplify and improve the administration and maintenance processes associated with these green spaces, ensuring their sustainability, functionality, and aesthetic appeal.

### Objectives of the Application
The primary goal of GSMS is to centralise and improve the management of urban green spaces. GSMS allows for the efficient coordination of a variety of tasks, including collaborator management, team organisation, vehicle and machinery management, and maintenance scheduling, by providing a single platform. GSMS enables users to effectively oversee and maintain green spaces, thereby contributing to their preservation and enhancement.

### Structure and Organization
GSMS is designed to meet the diverse requirements of green space managers and administrators. The application has a modular design, allowing users to access specific functionalities based on their roles and responsibilities. Key modules in GSMS include:

* **Collaborator Management:** Register and maintain information about collaborators, such as their professions, skills, and assigned tasks. Create team proposals based on the required competencies to optimise workforce allocation.
* **Vehicle Management:** Register and manage the vehicles used in green space management activities. Organise maintenance checks and manage vehicle-related tasks to ensure operational effectiveness.

### Main Features
* **Employee Registration and Management:** Easily register and manage information about collaborators, allowing for the assignment of tasks and skills to optimise team composition.


* **Vehicle Registration and Management:** Make the process of registering and managing vehicles used in green space management more efficient, ensuring proper maintenance and resource utilisation.


* **Team Proposal Generation:** Streamlines the formation of work teams by automatically producing proposals based on required competencies.
This feature evaluates the skills and qualifications of available employees and recommends the best team composition for specific tasks or projects. The application contributes to the efficient and effective completion of projects by optimising workforce allocation.


* **Water Consumption Cost Analysis:** Offers tools for calculating water consumption costs in specific green spaces. This feature collects and analyses water usage data to assist green space managers in identifying high consumption areas and potential inefficiencies.
  Cost analysis helps managers optimise water usage, reduce costs, and promote sustainability.


* **Optimal Route Determination:** Calculates the best routes for pipe installation within green spaces. This feature optimises water distribution by taking into account terrain, distance, and supply requirements. By optimising route planning, the application helps to develop robust irrigation systems that meet the needs of green spaces while minimising resource waste.


* **Equipment Usage Analysis:** The equipment usage analysis feature allows managers to monitor and analyse equipment usage in green spaces. This feature provides valuable insights into equipment efficiency and effectiveness by monitoring variables such as equipment utilisation rates, maintenance schedules, and performance metrics. With this information, managers can make informed decisions about equipment maintenance, replacement, and utilisation strategies.


* **User Portal Data Collection:** Data on park usage can be collected more easily from user portals. This feature helps managers collect data on visitor demographics, usage patterns, and preferences. Understanding how users interact with green spaces can help managers tailor maintenance and management strategies to meet park visitors' needs and expectations.
