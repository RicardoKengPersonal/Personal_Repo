# US005 - Build a station

## 1. Requirements Engineering

### 1.1. User Story Description

As a Player, I want to build a station.

### 1.2. Customer Specifications and Clarifications 

**From the specifications document:**

>	There are three types of stations: Depots (50k, 3x3 radius), Stations (100k, 4x4 radius), 
and Terminals (200k, 5x5 radius). Their cost and economic radius distinguish the stations. 

> When built, a station consists of just one building, which can be upgraded
with other buildings that can increase the stationâ€™s performance, improve
train operation, facilitate train manoeuvrers, and increase the lifespan of
cargo stored at the station.

**From the client clarifications:**

> **Question:** What is the input data for the user story 5? Is there any input besides the type of the station?
>
> **Answer:** Position; Station type (Terminal, Station or Depot) and, in the case of the station, the center must be 
> filled in. If the proposed is not accepted an alternative one must be entered.

> **Question:** Is the budget the only concern to build a station, or does the player also needs to have other 
> specific resources, like steel, etc.? Are resources included on the budget, or the budget represent only the player's monetary value?
>
> **Answer:** just the budget in a generic currency.
