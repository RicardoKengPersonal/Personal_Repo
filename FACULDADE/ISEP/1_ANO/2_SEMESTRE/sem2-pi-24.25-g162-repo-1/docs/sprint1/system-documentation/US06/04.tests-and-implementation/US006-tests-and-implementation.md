# US006 - As a Player, I want to upgrade a selected station with a building.

## 4. Tests 

**Test 1:** Ensure a station does not accept a building of an incompatible type

        @Test(expected = IllegalArgumentException.class)
        public void ensureIncompatibleBuildingIsRejected() {
        BuildingType typeA = new BuildingType("A", 1900, null, List.of());
        BuildingType typeB = new BuildingType("B", 1900, null, List.of(typeA));
        
            Station station = new Station("Central", new Location(5, 5), StationType.MAJOR);
            station.addBuilding(new Building(typeA));
            
            station.addBuilding(new Building(typeB)); // should fail
        }

**Test 2:** Ensure a player cannot upgrade if they cannot afford the building. 

        @Test
        public void ensureUpgradeFailsIfInsufficientResources() {
        BuildingType expensive = new BuildingType("Expensive", 1900, null, List.of());
        expensive.setCost(1000);
        
            Player player = new Player("user");
            player.setResources(Map.of("money", 500));
        
            boolean canAfford = player.canAfford(expensive.getCost());
        
            assertFalse(canAfford);
        }


**Test 3**: Ensure that valid upgrade replaces previous building if defined as a replacement.

        @Test
        public void ensureBuildingIsReplacedIfReplacementDefined() {
        BuildingType oldType = new BuildingType("Old", 1900, null, List.of());
        BuildingType newType = new BuildingType("New", 1950, oldType, List.of());
        
            Station station = new Station("Main", new Location(1, 1), StationType.MINOR);
            station.addBuilding(new Building(oldType));
            
            assertTrue(station.hasBuildingType(oldType));
            station.addBuilding(new Building(newType)); // replace
        
            assertFalse(station.hasBuildingType(oldType));
            assertTrue(station.hasBuildingType(newType));
        }

**Test 4:** Ensure player resources are deducted on successful building addition.

        @Test
        public void ensureResourcesAreDeductedOnSuccess() {
        BuildingType type = new BuildingType("Depot", 1900, null, List.of());
        type.setCost(300);
        
            Player player = new Player("test");
            player.setResources(Map.of("money", 500));
        
            player.deductResources(type.getCost());
        
            assertEquals(200, player.getResources().get("money").intValue());
        }


**Test 5:** Ensure available building types are returned correctly.

        @Test
        public void ensureAvailableBuildingTypesAreReturned() {
        List<BuildingType> types = controller.getListOfAvailableBuildingTypes();
        
            assertNotNull(types);
            assertFalse(types.isEmpty());
        }

**Test 6:** Ensure upgradeStationWithBuilding returns true when upgrade is successful.
        
        @Test
        public void ensureStationIsUpgradedSuccessfully() {
        Station station = new Station("North", new Location(2, 2), StationType.MINOR);
        BuildingType buildingType = new BuildingType("Warehouse", 1920, null, List.of());
        buildingType.setCost(100);
        
            controller.setStation(station);
            controller.setBuildingType(buildingType);
        
            boolean result = controller.upgradeStationWithBuilding(station, buildingType);
        
            assertTrue(result);
            assertTrue(station.hasBuildingType(buildingType));
        }

## 5. Construction (Implementation)

### Class UpgradeStationController 

```java
public boolean upgradeStationWithBuilding(Station station, BuildingType buildingType) {
    Player player = UserSession.getInstance().getCurrentPlayer();

    if (!player.canAfford(buildingType.getCost())) return false;

    if (station.hasBuildingType(buildingType) || station.hasIncompatible(buildingType))
        throw new IllegalArgumentException("Building type is incompatible or already exists");

    // Handle replacement
    BuildingType replacedType = buildingType.getReplaces();
    if (replacedType != null) {
        station.removeBuilding(replacedType);
    }

    player.deductResources(buildingType.getCost());
    station.addBuilding(new Building(buildingType));
    return true;
}

```

### Class Station

```java
public void addBuilding(Building building) {
    if (hasIncompatible(building.getType())) {
        throw new IllegalArgumentException("Incompatible building type");
    }
    buildings.add(building);
}

public boolean hasIncompatible(BuildingType newType) {
    for (BuildingType incompatible : newType.getIncompatibleWith()) {
        if (hasBuildingType(incompatible)) return true;
    }
    return false;
}

```


## 6. Integration and Demo 

* "Upgrade Station" option was added to the Station configuration panel in the UI.

* The UI allows users to select a station from a list of available ones, pick a building type, and preview upgrade cost and requirements.

* A scenario and station must be selected before the upgrade option is enabled.

* The playerâ€™s available resources are checked before confirming the upgrade.
