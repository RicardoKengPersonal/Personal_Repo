| Step 6         | ... retrieving the current scenario from the map?                           | Map                     | IE: knows the associated scenario.                                   |
| Step 7         | ... retrieving the available station types?                                 | Scenario                | Expert: knows the available station types.                           |
| Step 8         | ... creating StationType objects?                                           | Scenario / StationTypes | Creator + Expert: responsible for instantiating station types.       |
| Step 9         | ... mapping StationType entities to DTOs?                                   | StationTypeMapper       | Pure Fabrication: converts objects to Data Transfer Objects (DTOs).  |
| Step 10        | ... requesting coordinates and orientation (if applicable)?                 | ViewStationDetailsUI    | IE: decides what data to request based on station type.              |
| Step 11        | ... validating and creating positions with or without orientation?          | Position                | Expert: validates and represents positions on the map.               |
| Step 12        | ... validating if a position or station is valid in the context of the map? | Map                     | IE: knows the space and positioning rules.                           |
| Step 13        | ... generating the station name based on the position?                      | Map                     | Expert: logic for naming stations based on position.                 |
| Step 14        | ... creating the actual station?                                            | Station                 | Creator: represents the station entity.                              |
| Step 15        | ... adding and validating the station on the map?                           | Map                     | IE: maintains and validates the set of existing stations.            |
| Step 16        | ... presenting the result of the operation to the user?                     | BuildStationUI          | Pure Fabrication: communicates messages and results to the user.     |
| Step 17        | ... retrieving the acquisition price of a station type?                     | StationType             | Expert: knows its own price.                                         |
| Step 18        | ... retrieving the current player from the session?                         | UserSession             | Expert: holds the reference to the logged-in player.                 |
| Step 19        | ... validating and debiting the playerâ€™s currency to buy the station?       | Player                  | Expert: knows its own balance and handles currency validation/debit. |


### Systematization

According to the rationale above, the following conceptual classes were promoted to software classes:

#### Domain Entities:
- `Station`
- `StationType`
- `Position`
- `Map`
- `Scenario`
- `Industry`
- `Building`
- `CardinalPoints`

#### Infrastructure / Support:
- `Repositories` (Singleton)
- `MapRepository`
- `StationRepository`
- `StationTypeRepository`

#### Interface / Application:
- `BuildStationUI`
- `BuildStationController`
- `StationTypeMapper`
- `ApplicationSession`
- `UserSession`
