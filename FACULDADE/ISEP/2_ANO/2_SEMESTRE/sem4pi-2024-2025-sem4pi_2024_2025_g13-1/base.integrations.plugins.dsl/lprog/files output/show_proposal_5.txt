Show Proposal

Shodroneis a VIP client and Shodrone is pleased to submit for your consideration a proposal for the execution of an aerial show with drones, as described below.
Shodrone is a company that prioritizes safety, which is why it uses the most advanced AI technology to support the development of its shows, with all shows being previously and carefully tested/simulated with AI-Test© technology before being presented to the client. In the link https://server.local/simulations/proposal5.mp4 there is a video with a simulation of the proposed show.

With the application of AI-Test©, a Shodrone exclusive, we are confident in offering liability insurance in the amount of 1000€ for the show. Detailed show data is presented in the attachment.

Looking forward to hearing from you soon.

Best regards,
