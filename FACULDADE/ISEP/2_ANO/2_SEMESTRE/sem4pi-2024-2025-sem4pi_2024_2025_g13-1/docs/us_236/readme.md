US236 â€“ Edit a show request
==============================
---
# Analysis
    -A CRM Collaborator should be able to edit show requests that have not yet been accepted or canceled. Only editable fields may be changed.
    -This functionality ensures request details remain accurate before entering production.
---

## Business Rules

    -Only CRM Collaborators can edit show requests.
    -Only show requests in "Created" or "Pending" state can be edited.
    -Editable fields include:
    Place
    Time
    Tentative number of drones
    Duration
    Show Keyword (document)

    Exclusivity requirements
    -All modifications must be logged in the request history.
    -Customer must be "Active" for the edit to be allowed.



## Acceptance Criteria

    -A show request can be updated if it is in the proper state and the customer is active.
    -Attempting to edit a non-editable request results in an error.
    -History is updated with each successful edit.
    -Changes are persisted and reflected when listing the request.
