### 1.3. Acceptance Criteria

Non-Functional Requirements (NFR):

- NFR01 - Project management using scrum: Scrum should be used for project management. The group’s LAPR4 PL teacher will be the Scrum Master
  and there will be one weekly scrum meeting with the scrum Master during the LAPR4 PL+OT class.
  The Development Process document, available at Moodle7
  , provides detailed information regarding
  this requirement.
- NFR02 - Technical Documentation: Project documentation should be always available on the project repository ("docs" folder, markdown
  format) and, when applicable, in accordance to the UML notaƟon. The development process of every
  US (e.g.: analysis, design, tesƟng, etc.) must be reported (as part of the documentation). Whenever
  possible, the PlantUML tool shall be used to generate diagrams. The diagrams’ source files and the
  actual diagrams in a vector format (PNG) must be included in the repository.
- NFR03 - Test-driven development: The team should aim to adopt a test-driven development approach.
- NFR04 - Source Control : The source code of the solution as well as all the documentation and related artifacts should be
  versioned in a GitHub repository to be provided to the students. Only the main (master/main) branch
  will be used (e.g., as a source for releases)
- NFR05 - Continuous Integration :The Github repository will provide night builds with publishing of results and metrics.
- NFR06 - Deployment and Scripts : The repository should include the necessary scripts to build and deploy the solution in a variety of
  systems (at least Linux and Windows). It should also include a readme.md file in the root folder
  explaining how to build, deploy and execute the solution.
- NFR07 - Database by configuration: The system must support that data persistence is done either "in memory" or in a relational database
  (RDBMS). Although in-memory database solutions can be used during development and testing, the
  solution must include a final deployment where a remote persistent relational database is used. The
  system should have the ability to initialize some default data.
- NFR08 - Authentication and Authorization:The system must support and apply authentication and authorization for all its users and
  functionalities.
- NFR09 - Programming language : The solution should be implemented using Java as the main language. Other languages can be used in
  accordance with more specific requirements.
- NFR10 – Network sockets APIs
  The network sockets APIs may either implement a new application protocol developed for this purpose
  or use an existing standard application protocol, like HTTP.
- NFR11 – High-level language (DSL) and drones’ language analysis/validation
  The support for this functionality must follow specific technical requirements provided in LPROG. The
  ANTLR tool should be used.
- NFR12 – Simulation system in sprint 3 : Shodrone wants the simulation system to use a multithreaded parent process and child drone
  processes communicating via shared memory, with functionalities separated into dedicated threads
  (collision detection and report generation), so that the simulation runs step-by-step with robust
  synchronization using semaphores and can be terminated via signals when a collision threshold is
  exceeded.

### 1.5 Other Relevant Remarks
The  Non-Functional Requirements mentioned above will be guidelines that we will follow during our project.
