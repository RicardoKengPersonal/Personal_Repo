# US103 - As Project Manager, I want the team to configure the project structure to facilitate/accelerate the development of upcoming user stories.

## 1. Requirements Engineering

### 1.1. User Story Description

**As** Project Manager,  
**I want** the team to configure the overall project structure,  
**So that** the development of future user stories is faster, more consistent, and aligned with the chosen architecture and technologies.

---

### 1.2. Customer Specifications and Clarifications

- The structure must reflect the layered architecture envisioned for the project.
- It must support integration of tools such as:
    - ANTLR for DSL processing (**NFR11**).
    - GitHub Actions for CI (**US104**).
    - Java as the main language (**NFR09**).
- The structure must separate modules/components (e.g., backoffice server, customer app, simulators).
- It must include placeholder packages/directories and configuration files for:
    - Domain model
    - Application services
    - Infrastructure
    - Presentation layer
    - Persistence
- The structure should enable modularisation and the use of DDD (Domain-Driven Design) principles.

---

### 1.3. Acceptance Criteria

- **AC1**: The project includes a clearly defined and modular folder/package structure.
- **AC2**: The structure supports DDD layers: domain, application, infrastructure, and presentation.
- **AC3**: Placeholder files or classes exist to illustrate where future implementations will go.
- **AC4**: The structure supports integration of ANTLR and other required tools.
- **AC5**: The structure is committed to GitHub and documented in the `README.md`.
- **AC6**: The structure is compatible with CI workflows defined in **US104** and with scripts in **US105**.

---

### 1.4. Found out Dependencies

- **US101**: Technical constraints guide the structure (Java, DSL with ANTLR, multi-module system).
- **US110**: Domain model will be implemented based on this structure.
- **US104**: CI workflows depend on the project layout.
- **US105**: Build and execution scripts require a clear and stable structure.
- **NFR09**: Java is the base language; typical structure should follow Java conventions.

---

### 1.5. Suggested Tasks

- Define base folders/packages:
    - `/domain`, `/application`, `/infrastructure`, `/presentation`, `/simulator`, etc.
- Create placeholder configuration files (e.g., `pom.xml`, `build.gradle`, `settings.gradle`, etc.).
- Add README in each main folder explaining its purpose.
- Create initial empty classes/interfaces for key roles (e.g., services, controllers, entities).
- Integrate ANTLR tooling placeholder if DSL processing is expected.
- Verify structure works with build tools (Maven or Gradle).
- Commit the initial structure and push to GitHub.

---

### 1.6. Deliverables

- Complete base folder and package structure committed to the GitHub repository.
- Initial configuration files for the build tool (Maven/Gradle).
- Internal `README.md` files (or comments) documenting each main folder/module.
- Project structure explained in the main `README.md`.

---

### 1.7. Other Relevant Remarks

- The structure must be ready before the implementation of core user stories begins (e.g., domain model, authentication, DSL processing).
- The structure should reflect good architectural practices and be scalable to accommodate more features in upcoming sprints.
- It must support integration with CI/CD and test automation frameworks.
