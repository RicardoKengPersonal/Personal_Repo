Here is the corrected version of the SSD. The changes focus on the loop to more accurately describe the interactions.

@startuml

actor "CRM Collaborator" as CRM
participant "System" as System

CRM -> System : initiatesAddFiguresProcess()
System --> CRM : presentsEditableProposals(listOfProposals)
CRM -> System : selectsProposal(proposalID)

System --> CRM : requestsFigureSelectionMode()
CRM -> System : suppliesSelectionMode(mode)

loop while adding figures
System --> CRM : displaysCurrentFleetState(fleetState) and availableFiguresList
CRM -> System : selectsFigure(figureID)
System --> CRM : requestsDroneMappingForFigure(requiredTypes, compatibleModels)
