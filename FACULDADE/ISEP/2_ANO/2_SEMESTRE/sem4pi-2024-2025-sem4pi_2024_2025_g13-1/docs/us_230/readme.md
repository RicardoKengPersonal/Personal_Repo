## Business Rules

    - This use case handles the creation of a new Show Request by a CRM Collaborator, involving customers, figures, and exclusivity preferences.
    It is the entry point for new business from clients.

## Acceptance Criteria

    -Only CRM Collaborators can register a show request.
    -A show request can only be submitted for active customers.
    -VIP customers are prioritized over Regular customers.
    -If the customer does not exist in the system, it must be registered first (by a CRM Manager).
    -Custom figure requests trigger a design assignment by a CRM Manager.
