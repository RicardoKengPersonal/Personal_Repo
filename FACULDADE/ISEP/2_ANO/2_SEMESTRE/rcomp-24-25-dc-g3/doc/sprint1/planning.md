### Sprint master: 1230978 ###

# 1. Sprint's backlog #
# T.1.1 - Development of a structured cabling project for building 1.
# T.1.2 - Development of a structured cabling project for building 2.
# T.1.3 - Development of a structured cabling project for building 3.
# T.1.4 - Development of a structured cabling project for building 4.

# 2. Technical decisions and coordination #
* **Backbone cable types to be used:** Monomode 8 fiber is the most cost-effective decision solution for high-speed data transmission over long distances.
* **End-User Equipment Cable:** CAT 7
    - more resistant
    - more speed
    - low interference.
* **Cabling Infrastructure Standard:** 568A standard is more commonly used in Europe, so the team chose 568A.

# 3. Subtasks assignment #
* 1230540 - Development of a structured cabling project for building 1 with the backbone
* 1220849 - Development of a structured cabling project for building 2.
* 1230978 - Development of a structured cabling project for building 3.
