### USBD01 - As a Product Owner, I want a data dictionary/glossary to be created.

## 1. Requirements Engineering
###  1.1. User Story Description

As a Product Owner, I want a data dictionary/glossary to be created, so that all stakeholders can have a clear understanding of the system's terminology.

### 1.2. Customer Specifications and Clarifications
**From the specifications document:**

> The data dictionary should encompass all relevant terms related to the data model and the system's operations. This glossary should serve as a reference for both developers and non-technical stakeholders.

**From the client clarifications:**

> **Question:** The content of the glossary for this US is only for the BDDAD part of the project or is it supposed to be for the whole project?
> 
> **Answer:** The requirements are not divided by technical speciality. As such, there are no BDDAD requirements. There are only project requirements.

### 1.3. Acceptance Criteria
* **AC1:** The glossary must include key terms from all user stories and documents provided.
* **AC2:** It should be accessible from a shared platform (e.g., Visual Paradigm or a documentation platform).
* **AC3:** The terms should be organized alphabetically with clear definitions.

### 1.4. Found out Dependencies
* The system documentation must be available and complete to retrieve relevant terms.
* The glossary should be integrated into the overall system documentation for accessibility.
### 1.5 Input and Output Data
**Input Data:**

* System documentation and terms from user stories.
  **Output Data:**

* A complete data dictionary/glossary that includes key terms and definitions.

### 1.6. Other Relevant Remarks
The glossary should be continuously updated as more terms are defined or clarified throughout the project. It is important that all stakeholders have access to it.
