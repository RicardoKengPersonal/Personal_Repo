# Let's create a test script for the procedure "ReserveMaterials" and save it as a .txt file

test_script = """

-- Execution: Call the procedure ReserveMaterials(idOrder) for an order that has enough stock.
-- Expected Outcome: Materials should be successfully reserved, and no errors should occur.

BEGIN
    -- Assuming idOrder = 1 exists and has enough stock
    ReserveMaterials(1);
END;
/

-- Test Case 2: Invalid Order ID (Non-Existent Order)
-- Setup: Ensure the idOrder provided to the procedure does not exist in the customerOrder table.
-- Execution: Call the procedure ReserveMaterials(idOrder) with a non-existent order ID.
-- Expected Outcome: The procedure should raise an exception and output an error message indicating that the order does not exist.

BEGIN
    -- Assuming idOrder = 999 does not exist
    ReserveMaterials(999);
